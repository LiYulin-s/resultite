    # 5. Install dependencies using uv
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        # Install the package itself in editable mode + any test dependencies
        uv pip install -e .[test]

    # 6. Run tests using unittest discovery
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        python -m unittest discover tests # Assumes tests are in the 'tests' directory
